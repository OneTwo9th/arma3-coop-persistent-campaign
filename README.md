==============================

This project is licensed under the MIT-License. 
However, learning how to write SQF-Scripts took a long time of reading through the forums and 
peeking in missions of other smart peoples. Many ideas grew from this investigations, so it is 
sometimes hard to draw the line of mine and theirs. Many scripts where completely reworked, some
only included. I was looking around in the forums for distinct license information of the code 
that I used, but found no information on that. So I keep with the MIT license for the best of 
my knowledge. I someone is having problems with this license, or thinking that he should be mentioned
in the credits, please let me know. I have no criminal intend of stealing peoples their credtiting.
